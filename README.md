### ü§© What This Script Does For You!

Think of this script as your personal DevOps buddy. It automates:

*   **‚ö°Ô∏è N8N Installation (via Docker):** Gets the core N8N platform running in a containerized environment.
*   **üêò PostgreSQL Database Setup:** Automatically sets up and configures a PostgreSQL database container for N8N, providing a robust backend for your workflows and execution data.
*   **üõ†Ô∏è Custom N8N Docker Image:** Builds a special N8N image pre-loaded with:
    *   `FFmpeg`: For all your video/audio processing needs.
    *   `yt-dlp`: The super handy tool for downloading videos (perfect for YouTube!).
    *   `Puppeteer` (`n8n-nodes-puppeteer` included): For powerful web scraping and browser automation.
    *   `postgresql-client`: To ensure N8N can communicate with the PostgreSQL database.
*   **üîí Automatic SSL/TLS:** Sets up Caddy as a reverse proxy, automatically securing your N8N instance with a free SSL certificate from Let's Encrypt (highly recommended!) or an internal one for testing.
*   **üß† Smart Swap Memory Setup:** Checks your server's RAM and automatically configures swap space if needed, ensuring smoother performance for N8N.
*   **üíæ Daily Automatic Full Backup:** Protects your hard work by backing up all your N8N workflows, credentials (including the crucial N8N encryption key), and the **PostgreSQL database** daily.
*   **üîÑ Auto-Update Mechanism:** Keeps your N8N instance and `yt-dlp` (both on host and in container) up-to-date automatically, without you lifting a finger!
*   **üîê Secure Credential Generation:** Automatically generates strong, random passwords for PostgreSQL and a unique encryption key for N8N, displaying them to you at the end of the installation for your records.
*   **Persistent Data Storage:** Your N8N configuration, uploaded files, and PostgreSQL data are safely stored on your host machine using Docker volumes, even if containers are recreated.
*   **üó£Ô∏è User-Friendly & Interactive:** Guides you through the process with clear questions and helpful messages.
*   **üõ°Ô∏è Idempotent (Mostly):** You can safely run this script multiple times! It's smart enough to detect what's already installed/configured and will attempt to update or skip. Database credentials are generated once per initial setup.

### üöÄ Getting Started (It's Super Easy!)

Before we begin, make sure your server meets a few basic requirements:

#### ‚ú® Prerequisites

*   **A Fresh VPS/Server:** Running a Debian or Ubuntu-based operating system (e.g., Ubuntu 20.04+, Debian 10+).
*   **Root or Sudo Access:** You'll need to run the script with `sudo` privileges.
*   **Active Domain/Subdomain:** Your chosen domain (e.g., `n8n.yourdomain.com`) must be pointed to your server's public IP address via an `A` record in your DNS settings. The script will double-check this for you!
*   **Open Ports:** Ensure ports **80 (HTTP)** and **443 (HTTPS)** are open on your server's firewall. Caddy needs these for SSL and web traffic.
    *   *Example for UFW firewall:*
        ```bash
        sudo ufw allow 80/tcp
        sudo ufw allow 443/tcp
        sudo ufw enable # If UFW isn't active yet
        ```
*   **Internet Connection:** Your VPS needs to be connected to the internet to download packages.

#### üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Installation Steps

Ready to get your N8N superpower? Follow these simple steps:

1.  **Connect to Your VPS:** Open your terminal and SSH into your server.
    ```bash
    ssh user@your_server_ip
    ```

2.  **Clone the Repository:** Grab the script from GitHub.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/satriyabajuhitam/auto-n8n-complete-v2.git 
    ```

3.  **Navigate to the Script Directory:**
    ```bash
    cd auto-n8n-complete-v2
    ```

4.  **Give the Script Permission to Run:**
    ```bash
    chmod +x complete-deploy-n8n.sh 
    ```

5.  **Run the Script!** This is the exciting part!
    ```bash
    sudo ./complete-deploy-n8n.sh
    ```
    *   The script will start chatting with you!
    *   It will ask you for your **domain or subdomain** (e.g., `n8n.example.com`). Type it in and hit Enter. The script will verify if it's pointing correctly.
    *   It will then ask if you want to use **Let's Encrypt for SSL**.
        *   **Highly Recommended (`y`):** Say `y` and provide your email address. Caddy will automatically handle getting and renewing your trusted SSL certificate.
        *   **For Testing (`n`):** If you say `n`, it will use an internal SSL certificate, and your browser will show a privacy warning. This is fine for testing but not for public access.

6.  **Sit Back and Relax:** The script will take care of the rest! It will install Docker, set up PostgreSQL, build your custom N8N image, set up Caddy, configure backups, and get everything running. This process might take a few minutes, so maybe grab a coffee! ‚òï

### üéâ Post-Installation Goodies!

Once the script finishes, you'll see a success message and **important credentials**. Here's what you need to know:

*   **Access N8N:** You can now open your web browser and visit:
    üëâ **`https://YOUR.DOMAIN`** (replace `YOUR.DOMAIN` with the domain you entered)

*   **N8N's Home:** All your N8N configuration, custom files, and script files are stored safely in:
    `$N8N_DIR` (default: `/home/n8n`)

*   **N8N Encryption Key:**
    *   **Location:** `$N8N_DIR/.n8n/encryptionKey`
    *   **Crucial:** This key is essential for N8N to decrypt your credentials. It's automatically included in backups. **Store this key securely offline as well!**

*   **Auto-Update:** Your N8N instance will check for updates and update itself every 12 hours.
    *   Update Log: `$N8N_DIR/update.log`

*   **Backups:** Daily backups of your N8N workflows, N8N encryption key, and the PostgreSQL database run automatically at **2 AM** server time.
    *   Backup Files: `$N8N_DIR/files/backup_full/n8n_full_backup_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.tar.gz`
    *   The script keeps the 30 most recent backups.
    *   Backup Log: `$N8N_DIR/files/backup_full/backup.log`

*   **YouTube Data:** Any videos downloaded via `yt-dlp` through N8N will be saved in:
    `$N8N_DIR/files/youtube_data/`

*   **`yt-dlp` on Host:** If you want to use `yt-dlp` directly from your server's command line (outside of N8N), you might need to manually add `~/.local/bin` to your `PATH` environment variable after logging out and back in.

### üõ°Ô∏è Making Your N8N "Production Ready" & Secure!

The installation script gets you a great start with a PostgreSQL backend, but for a truly robust and secure production environment, consider these extra steps.

#### 1. Enhanced Security Measures

*   **Strong Admin Credentials:** After your first login to N8N, **immediately set a strong, unique password** for your administrator account.
*   **Firewall Hardening:** The script opens ports 80 and 443 for Caddy.
    *   **Crucially, ensure port 5678 (N8N's internal port) and 5432 (PostgreSQL's default port) are NOT open to the public** on your VPS firewall. They are only needed for internal communication between Docker containers.
    *   Consider limiting SSH access (port 22) to only your known IP addresses if possible.
*   **Secure Secret Management (Beyond this script):** The script handles PostgreSQL password generation securely. For other sensitive N8N workflow credentials, always use N8N's built-in credential management.
*   **Regular Host OS Updates:** Beyond N8N and Docker updates (handled by the script), keep your underlying VPS operating system updated.
    ```bash
    sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
    sudo apt autoremove -y
    sudo reboot # After kernel or critical updates
    ```

#### 2. Stability & High Availability

*   **PostgreSQL Performance Tuning (Advanced):** For very high-load scenarios, you might explore PostgreSQL performance tuning options. The default configuration is generally good for most N8N use cases.
*   **Container Resource Limits:** Prevent N8N, PostgreSQL, or Caddy from hogging all your server's resources. Add `deploy.resources.limits` to your `docker-compose.yml` services:
    ```yaml
    services:
      n8n:
        # ...
        deploy:
          resources:
            limits:
              cpus: '2.0'  # Max 2 CPU cores
              memory: 4096M # Max 4GB RAM
      postgres:
        # ...
        deploy:
          resources:
            limits:
              cpus: '1.0'
              memory: 2048M # Adjust based on your DB size and activity
      caddy:
        # ...
        deploy:
          resources:
            limits:
              cpus: '0.5'
              memory: 256M
    ```
    *Adjust these values based on your VPS specs and N8N's workload.*
*   **Monitoring & Alerting:** Don't wait for things to break! Set up monitoring for:
    *   **N8N/Caddy/PostgreSQL Uptime:** Are the services running?
    *   **VPS Resource Usage:** CPU, RAM, Disk I/O, disk space.
    *   **N8N Health:** N8N has a `/healthz` endpoint you can monitor.
    *   **PostgreSQL Health:** Monitor query performance, connections, etc.
    *   **Tools:** Simple tools like UptimeRobot, or more advanced solutions like Prometheus/Grafana (for metrics) and Loki/Grafana or an ELK stack (for centralized logs). Integrate alerts to Slack, email, etc.
*   **Off-site Backups & Disaster Recovery Plan:** The script backs up to your server. For true production readiness, **move these backups to an off-site location** (e.g., S3, Google Cloud Storage, Dropbox, or another server).
    *   **Crucially:** **Regularly TEST your disaster recovery process!** This includes restoring the PostgreSQL database from a backup.

#### 3. Performance Optimizations

*   **Adequate VPS Resources:** N8N, especially with Puppeteer or heavy workflows, and PostgreSQL can be resource-intensive. If you experience slowdowns, consider upgrading your VPS's RAM and CPU.
*   **Timezone Verification:** The script sets `GENERIC_TIMEZONE=Asia/Jakarta`. Ensure this is correct for your location in `docker-compose.yml`.

#### 4. Logging Management

*   **Host Log Rotation:** Ensure your host system logs (`/var/log/syslog`, Docker logs) are properly rotated to prevent disk space issues. `logrotate` is usually pre-configured but it's good to check.
*   **Centralized Logging (Optional):** For larger setups, consider pushing container logs (N8N, PostgreSQL, Caddy) to a centralized logging system.

#### 5. Documentation

*   **Document Your Setup:** Even with an automated script, keep a personal record of your domain, SSL choices, **the generated PostgreSQL credentials and N8N encryption key (stored securely!)**, any custom modifications, and your backup/recovery procedures.
